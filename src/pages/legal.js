After the Content is successfully uploaded, a link is made available allowing Users to share the Content. Customer retains ownership of the Content.

					<p>
						<strong>4.5 Feedback. </strong>Customer may choose to or Framer may invite Customer to submit feedback about the Service, including without limitation about how to improve the Services or our products (“Feedback”). By submitting any Feedback, Customer agrees that disclosure is without restriction and will not place Framer under any fiduciary or other obligation.

					<h2>
						<br />
					</h2>
					<h2>5. Customer’s Obligations to End Users</h2>
					<p>Any natural persons accessing or using Customer’s websites, pages, or content created by Customer on the Services are Customer’s “<strong>End Users.</strong>” Framer does not have a direct relationship with End Users, therefore Framer is not responsible for how Customer handles End User information.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>a) Applicable laws. </strong>Customer may have additional obligations under local law other than those described in this Agreement. Use of the Services does not ensure compliance with such laws, nor is Framer responsible for Customer’s compliance with such laws. To the extent Framer has any obligations to assist Customer with handling End User information, such obligations are enumerated within a Data Processing Agreement executed between Framer and Customer.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>b) Security towards End Users.</strong> Customer will use all reasonable efforts to protect information collected from End Users via the use of the Services, including any personal data obtained from unauthorized access or use. In the event Customer discovers that the End User information collected by Customer has been breached, compromised, or inadvertently exposed to non-authorized third parties, Customer shall notify Framer of such a breach or exposure within 72 hours including the root cause, remediation steps, and compensating controls to ensure such a breach does not occur in the future.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>c) Security Notification. </strong>Customer is responsible for providing notification to its End Users, third parties, or authorities under the applicable breach notification statutes and any other applicable data protection laws. Customer acknowledges that Customer is solely responsible for any personal injury or property damage arising from or relating to Customer’s use of any Services.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>d) Privacy. </strong>Customer acknowledges and agrees that Customer is solely responsible for providing any required notices and obtaining all required consents from End Users in connection with any use of the Services. Customer’s notice and consent must be compliant with all applicable data protection and security laws and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing, before collecting or using any End User information, Customer must provide adequate notice of the End User information Customer collects, how it will be used and/or shared, and obtain any necessary consents required under the applicable data protection laws and regulations. Customer agrees to comply with all data protection laws and regulations (including those applying to personal information) in connection with Customer’s access and use of the Services.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>e) Notice</strong>. Customer will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for Customer’s use of the Services that: (i) complies with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, (ii) is conspicuously displayed to all End Users, and (iii) clearly and accurately describes to End Users what information Customer collects (such as login information, contact form data, cookies, etc.) and how Customer uses and shares such information (including for marketing and advertising) with Framer and other third parties.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>f) Privacy rights.</strong> Customer will respond to any End Users wishing to exercise their privacy rights, under the applicable law, as it relates to any information collected via Customer’s use of the Services. For example, if End Users located in certain jurisdictions may exercise a “right to be forgotten” (or “erasure”) to the information Customer has collected about them, Customer shall comply with their request as required by applicable law. For clarity, Customer is directly responsible (or, the “data controller”) for the information processed by Customer’s use of the Services, including any information processed via third-party applications available on the Services. Framer is not a data controller to such information and is not responsible for responding to End Users on Customer’s behalf. To the extent Framer receives a request from an End User or authority about Customer’s use of the Services, Framer will notify Customer as permitted by law.</p>
					<h2>
						<br />
					</h2>
					<h2>6. Security</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>6.1</strong> Framer will use procedural, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to ensure the confidentiality, security, integrity, availability, and privacy of Content and other Customer Confidential Information stored in the Services. Framer regularly monitors compliance with these measures. Customer is responsible for reviewing the information made available by Framer relating to data security and making an independent determination as to whether the Services meets Customer’s requirements and legal obligations. Customer acknowledges that Framer’s security measures are subject to technical progress and development and that Framer may update or modify such measures from time to time provided that such updates and modifications do not result in a material decrease of the overall security of the Services during a subscription term.</p>
					<h2>
						<br />
					</h2>
					<h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>7.1 Confidential Information​. </strong>Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.2, all information disclosed by one party to the other party during the term of this Agreement that is identified in writing at the time of disclosure as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of the disclosure, whether in oral, written, graphic, electronic, or other form, shall be deemed to be “​Confidential Information​”. The existence and terms of this Agreement are Confidential Information of both parties.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>7.2 Exceptions​.</strong> Information will not be considered Confidential Information if the receiving party can establish by documentary evidence that the information is or was: (a) is publicly available or in the public domain at the time of disclosure through no fault of the receiving Party; (b) rightfully communicated to the receiving Party by persons not bound by confidentiality obligations with respect thereto; (c) already in the receiving Party’s possession free of any confidentiality obligations with respect thereto at the time of disclosure; (d) independently developed by the receiving Party without any use of or by persons who have access to the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; or (e) is approved in writing for release or disclosure by the disclosing Party without restriction.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>7.3 Nondisclosure​.</strong> During the Term of this Agreement, either Party may disclose Confidential Information to the other Party. Each ​Party agrees that all items of Confidential Information are proprietary to the disclosing Party or such third party, as applicable, and will remain the sole property of the disclosing Party or such third party. Each Party further agrees: (a) to use Confidential Information disclosed by the disclosing Party only for the purposes described herein; and (b) that the receiving Party will not reproduce Confidential Information disclosed by the disclosing Party, except as necessary to carry out the receiving Party's obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement, and will hold in confidence and protect such disclosing Party's Confidential Information from dissemination to, and use by, any third party.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>7.4 Legally Required Disclosure​. </strong>Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose Confidential Information to ​the limited extent required in order to comply with the order of a court or other governmental body, or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable law or legal requirement, provided that the receiving Party shall first have given notice to the disclosing Party (to the extent permitted) and shall have provided assistance to the disclosing Party as may be reasonably requested to limit such disclosure.</p>
					<h2>
						<br />
					</h2>
					<h2>8. Fees and Payment</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>8.1 Payment Terms. </strong>Customer will pay to Framer, without offset or deduction, all fees due under this Agreement. All payments will be in U.S. dollars.

All amounts will exclude all applicable sales, use, and other taxes.</p>
					<p>

					<p>

For an Enterprise license, Customer may contact Framer separately.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>8.4 Authorization of Recurring Payments.</strong> All pricing plans involve recurring fees (each, along with any applicable taxes and other charges). Customers on a monthly payment plan will be charged for additional editors at the next monthly renewal date. Customers on an annual plan will be charged for additional editors monthly. This is separate from their annual billing. Additional editors added to Customer’s team will not include a discount. The discounted editor rate is only available when pre-purchasing extra editors.&nbsp; Read more about additional editor charges <a href="data:framer/page-link,RDeC5VSqR?collection=local-module%3Acollection%2FAZ8SiArQR%3Adefault&amp;collectionItemId=WW2OzAYbG&amp;pathVariables=kBX6zGqQz%3Dhow-to-manage-charges">here</a>. The self-service subscriptions and any additional Services added to your self-service subscription will automatically-renew for the same term as the initial term.</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise agreed in the applicable Order Form, Enterprise Customers will be notified in writing if they exceed their purchased inclusions. Overuse will be billed pro rata through the end of the subscription term. An invoice or payment link will be sent to the Enterprise Customer upon notification.</p>
					<p>Framer’s fees are subject to change, although Framer will notify Customer before any change. Customer hereby acknowledges that the Services have recurring payment features and Customer accepts responsibility for all recurring payment obligations. Framer (or Paddle) will automatically charge Customer in accordance with the term of their subscription (e.g., each month, quarter, or year).</p>
					<p>
						<strong>8.5 Fair Use. </strong>Customer’s subscription offering will be specified on the applicable Order Form or Framer’s pricing page. Customer can purchase additional usage and data at the specified rate on the pricing page or in the Order Form. Framer will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with sufficient bandwidth, builds, and serverless function that Framer determines are typical of projects at Customer’s plan level. Framer will notify Customer if their usage is unreasonable, and may shut down and terminate projects and accounts that are creating an unreasonable burden on Framer's infrastructure and/or business operations.&nbsp;</p>

						<strong>10.1 </strong>Except for claims arising from customer’s misappropriation of Framer’s intellectual property rights in the Services: (a) in no event will either party be liable to the other party for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages, regardless of the nature of the claim, including, without limitation, lost profits, costs of delay, any failure of delivery, business interruption, costs of lost or damaged data, or liabilities to third parties arising from any source, even if such party has been advised of the possibility of damages; and (b) the cumulative liability of Framer to Customer for all claims arising from this agreement, including, without limitation, any cause of action sounding in contract, tort, or strict liability, will not exceed the fees paid to Framer by Customer during the twelve month period prior to the event giving rise to any claim.

					<p>
						<strong>11.1 By Framer​. </strong>Framer will defend at its expense any suit brought against Customer by a third party, and will pay any settlement Framer makes or approves, or any damages finally awarded in such suit, insofar as such suit is based on a claim by any third party alleging that the Services (excluding Packages, Components, Templates, and Content) misappropriates any trade secret recognized under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act or infringes any copyright or trademark issued as of the Effective Date.

					<p>
						<strong>12.4 Suspension​. </strong>If Customer fails to pay any undisputed amounts hereunder or, as necessary to protect the security of the Services, Framer will have the right, in addition to any of its other rights or remedies, to immediately suspend access to the Services to Customer and/or any of its User(s), without liability, until such amounts are paid in full or such threat no longer exists, as applicable.</p>

					<h2>13. Miscellaneous</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>13.1 Integration. </strong>This Agreement is the entire agreement between the Parties related to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings and discussions. You and Framer B.V. waive their rights to rescind or annul these Terms. Articles 3:44, 6:228 and 6:265 of the Dutch Civil Code are excluded. This Agreement shall supersede the terms of any purchase order or other business form. If accepted by Framer, Customer’s purchase order shall be binding only as to the following terms: the Services ordered and the appropriately calculated fees due. Other terms shall be void.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>13.2 Construction; Interpretation​. </strong>If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, that provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the Parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force. No waiver hereunder will be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the Party against whom enforcement of such waiver is sought.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>13.3</strong> No Agency Relationship; No Third Party Beneficiaries​. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to create any agency, partnership, or joint venture between the Parties, and neither Party will represent itself as an agent or legal representative of the other Party. To the extent that any third party stipulation is contained in this Agreement, article 6:254 of the Dutch Civil Code is excluded. The Parties acknowledge that the covenants set forth in this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of the Parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>13.4 Amendment.</strong> Framer may modify this Agreement (which may include changes to Framer’s pricing and plans) from time to time by giving notice to Customer by email or through the Services. Unless a shorter period is specified by Framer (e.g., due to changes in the Law or exigent circumstances), modifications become effective upon renewal of Customer’s current Subscription Term or entry into a new Order Form. If Framer specifies that the modifications to the Agreement will take effect prior to Customer’s next renewal or Order Form and Customer notifies Framer of its objection to the modifications within 30 days after the date of such notice, Framer (at its option and as Customer’s exclusive remedy) will either: (a) permit Customer to continue under the existing version of this Agreement until expiration of the then-current subscription term (after which time the modified Agreement will go into effect) or (b) allow Customer to terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of any pre-paid fees allocable to the terminated portion of the applicable subscription term. Customer may be required to click to accept or otherwise agree to the modified Agreement in order to continue using the Services, and, in any event, continued use of the Services after the updated version of this Agreement goes into effect will constitute Customer’s acceptance of such updated version.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>13.5 Governing Law; Arbitration​. </strong>This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with Dutch law without regard to international law regulations or principles of law leading to the application of other laws. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement. Any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) rules.

The award rendered thereon by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties thereto, and judgment thereon shall be confidential and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section 12.2 shall prevent either Party from applying to a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable or injunctive relief.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>13.6 Force Majeure.</strong> Any delay in the performance of any duties or obligations of either Party (except the payment of money owed) will not be considered a breach of this Agreement if such delay is caused by any event beyond the control of such Party, provided that such Party uses reasonable efforts to notify the other Party of the cause of such delay and to resume performance as soon as possible.</p>
